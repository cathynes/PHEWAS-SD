This set of code is to perform a PHEWAS of multiple genes and phenotypes. The phenotypes are based of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms mapped to ICD10 code and a number of physical measurement and biological sample from the UK-Biobank.

1.  HPO terms extraction: In this step, we first  extract the HPO term of the target syndromic diseases of interest from https://hpo.jax.org/app/. The HPO term were then matched to ICD10 code and others biobank phenotypes using SORTA https://molgenis19.gcc.rug.nl/.

1. Quality control of the phenotype matching and extrcation of the most accurate phenotype matching 

1. Extract the varaints related to the genes of interested 

1. Perform the analysis at the SNP levels then at the genes levels

1. Organize the results with tables and figures
